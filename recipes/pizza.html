        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
        <li>3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 can (14 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
     </ul>
     
     <h3>Steps</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Let it sit for about 5 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine 3 1/2 cups of flour and the salt. Make a well in the center and add the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until a dough forms. If the dough is too sticky, add more flour, a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead for about 8-10 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and oregano. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer for about 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat as well.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into two equal parts for two pizzas. Roll each part into a ball.</li>
        <li>On a floured surface, roll out each ball of dough into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to a pizza peel or a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Arrange the mozzarella slices evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately scatter fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and season with a bit of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve hot.</li>
     </ol>
