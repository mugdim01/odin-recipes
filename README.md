This simple HTML project is about 3 different recipes, pizza, spaghetti and banana pancakes. 

I used my basic HTML knowledge to complete this project, specifically, I used heading tags, anchor tags, paragraph tag, img tag, ordered and unordered lists. 

I also used some simple CSS knowledge to style all HTML elements.
